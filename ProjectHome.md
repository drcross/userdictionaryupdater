## What is it? ##

UserDictionaryUpdater is a program which adds words to your Android user dictionary based in a text file.

You write all the words in this file, one word per line, and UserDictionaryUpdater will add them to your Android user dictionary. It is easier to add words than typing them one at a time in the keyboard.


## How it works? ##

Create in the root of your sdcard a file called **CustomDictionary.txt**. In it, write one word per line which you want to be added to your User Dictionary. When you press the button "Load Dictionary" it will load your words. That's it! Pretty easy, huh? :)
